# obj-to-sheet

Export your JavaScript objects into one of the following spreadsheet file formats: `.xlsx`, `Google Sheets`, `.csv (Not implemented yet)`

### Google Sheets
Google Sheets API is being accessed through service account credentials generated by Google. See ["Authentication" section in docs](https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-spreadsheet/#/guides/authentication?id=service-account) for more info on how to make one.

It's required to use an existing Google spreadsheet with write rights granted to the service account email, as document created with a service account may not be accessible to your Google account. `spreadsheetId` is the long ID in the sheets URL.
