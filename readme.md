## Environment
Environment values for Google Spreadsheets API are copied from service account credentials generated by Google. See ["Authentication" section in docs](https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-spreadsheet/#/getting-started/authentication) for more info.

It's required to use an existing Google spreadsheet with write rights granted to the service account email, as document created with a service account may not be accessible to your Google account. `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` is the long ID in the sheets URL.

Required environment values:

	GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID
	GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
	GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY
